# Examples

The `examples/` directory is a growing & living folder, and open for contributions.

Each example has its own isolated [StackBlitz](https://new.viem.sh) project, so folks can easily play around with the example.

The below list is not exhaustive, and is a work in progress. If you have an idea for an example that is not listed below, please open a [discussion thread](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem/discussions/new?category=feature-request&title=Example%20Request:) proposing your idea. If you wish to take on an example that is not completed, go ahead!
